# The_Prisoner
Brackey's Feb Game Jam 2024

# The theme was, "whats behind the door". 
- My idea with this game for the week long game jam was to do a arena style fighting game where the player first chooses one of the three doors to reveal what enemy they'll be fighting. Then you complete the round and pick a new door. You also have the ability to get lucky and pick a new, possibly more powerful weapon when choosing a door.

# Inspiration
- I wanted to do something like Prison of Elders from Destiny 1 where you get a random enemy and must survive a few rounds of waves of that enemy before getting a new one.
